# Snake-Game

1. Building the classic snake game using the concepts of inheritance and OOP along with turtle module.
2. The game keeps track of the user's high score using the concepts of reading and writing into a file.
3. The snake is made up of many segments, where each segment is a turtle in the shape of a square.
4. The snake is moved in such a way that the segment at position i takes the positon of segment at position i-1. This ensures that the tail of the snake follows it heads.This way, only the direction of head needs to be controlled.
5. Event listeners are used to control the snake using arrow keys.
6. If there is a collision with the food, the length of snake increases and the score increases by one.
7. In case of collision with the wall or tail, the game is ended and the game restarts with score reset to 0.
