1. Building the classic snake game
2. The snake is made up of many segments, where each segment is a turtle in the shape of a square.
3. OOP
4.The segments are designed such that the tail of the snake will always follow where the head is going.
This way, only the direction of head needs to be controlled.
5.

Concepts of inheritance and OOP are used
1. Creates a snake class
2. The snake is made up of many segments, where each segment is a turtle in the shape of a square.
3. Initially the snake is made of 3 segments and it keeps on increasing as it eats the food.
4. The snake is moved in such a way that the segment at position i takes the positon of segment
position i-1. This ensures that the tail of the snake follows it heads.
5. Event listeners are used to control the snake using arrow keys.
6. Food class and Scoreboard class inherit the turtle class.
7. write method of turtle class is used to display the score of the game
8. If there is a collision with the food, the length of snake increases and the score increases by one.
9. In case of collision with the wall or with the tail, the game is ended and the game over message is displayed.
